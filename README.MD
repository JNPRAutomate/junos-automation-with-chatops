Chatops is about humans chatting to Bots (and the other way around).  
A more formal definition would be the concept of delegating tasks to a bot.  
 
This repo is about chatops for Junos automation. 
It provides a dockerized and slack integrated bot for junos automation.  
The repo is actually based on slack and hubot and content for junos automation (ansible playbooks, python scripts, jinja2 templates ...). So you can delegate junos automation tasks chatting to hubot with slack.
