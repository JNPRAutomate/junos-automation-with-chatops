Chatops is about humans chatting to Bots (and the other way around) to delegate tasks.   
This repo is about chatops for Junos automation: it provides a dockerized and slack integrated bot for junos automation.  
The repo is actually based on slack and hubot and junos automation content (ansible playbooks, python scripts, jinja2 templates ...), so we can delegate junos automation tasks chatting to hubot with slack. 
Please visit [wiki](https://github.com/ksator/junos-automation-with-chatops-in-ams/wiki) for the instructions.
